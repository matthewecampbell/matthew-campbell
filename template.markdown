# Matthew Campbell - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

In this module I set out to become proficient in the Ruby programming langauge and be able to create fully functional programs.

I aimed to be the best academic student I can be, devoting as much time as I could to make sure that I am proficient with each of the lessons of the day in addition to things I learn on
my own.

I also hope to help other students in 1605 as much as I can because in addition to it being helpful for them, it is good for me to go over material.

### Work

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)

* [Flashcards Project](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/flashcards)
* [Original Flashcards Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

The intention of this project was to create a program that allows the user to study flashcards through the terminal.

The project was designed to teach good behavior by attacking small problems and using test driven development.

**Instructor Notes:**

Fixing tests for later - will adjust score accordingly with fixed tests
Good use of setup method and sad path tests on round class
Could use some refactoring on big methods
Great work on extensions
Scores:

**Project Scores:**

*1. Functional Expectations*

4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality as well as two extensions.

*2. Test-Driven Development*

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

*3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components*

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

*4. Fundamental Ruby & Style*

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

*5. Enumerable & Collections*

4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
